## Public Keys
This repository contains a copy of the public keys that I use to sign things.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using the keys included in this repo, check their validity.
> Here are some ways that you can do that:
> 1. Check the git history
>     I won't remove/modify keys from this repository, I will add a note to the table below. If a key is modified in the git history, don't trust it.
> 2. Check the signature of the commit that it was added in
>     All commits to this repository will be signed by `luke.needle@development.lukeneedle.uk`
> 3. Check the mirrors
>     This repository is mirrored between my [github](https://github.com/LukeNeedle/keys) and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/LukeNeedle/keys). Check that they both say the same thing (and everything is signed with the same key)
> 4. Check the key file signatures
>     Included in this repository are the public key files with a signature file alongside them. Each public key file has been signed by `root@keys.lukeneedle.uk`. Check that the signatures are valid.
